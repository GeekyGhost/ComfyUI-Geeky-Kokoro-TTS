   - Formant Shift: -3.0
   - Reverb Amount: 0.4
   - EQ Bass: 0.6
   - Keep effect blend around 0.7 for realism

### Multi-Node Processing

For more advanced workflows, try these techniques:

1. **Voice Layering**:
   - Create two separate TTS nodes with the same text
   - Process each through separate Voice Mod nodes with different settings
   - Mix the outputs with an audio mixer node
   - Great for creating chorus effects or otherworldly voices

2. **Progressive Effects**:
   - Chain multiple Voice Mod nodes together
   - Apply subtle effects at each stage
   - Example chain: Basic voice ‚Üí Pitch/Formant ‚Üí Reverb/Echo ‚Üí EQ/Compression
   - This creates more natural transitions between effects

3. **Dynamic Text Processing**:
   - Split text by character/emotion
   - Process each segment with appropriate voice settings
   - Combine the audio segments afterward
   - Creates more dynamic and expressive narration

## üîç Advanced Technical Details

### Effect Processing Architecture

The Voice Mod node uses a sophisticated multi-layered approach to audio processing:

1. **Quality Tiers**:
   - **High Quality**: Uses librosa and resampy for premium sound quality
   - **Medium Quality**: Falls back to scipy-based algorithms if resampy is unavailable
   - **Basic Quality**: Uses numpy-only implementations if both advanced libraries are missing

2. **Processing Sequence**:
   - Voice profile or manual parameters are evaluated
   - Effects are applied in optimized order (pitch ‚Üí formant ‚Üí spatial ‚Üí tone ‚Üí dynamics)
   - Blending is applied with original audio
   - Volume adjustment and soft clipping prevent distortion

3. **Resource Management**:
   - Automatic threading for model loading
   - Efficient memory usage with tensor conversions
   - Error recovery with graceful fallbacks
   - Automatic cleanup of temporary resources

### Parameter Sensitivity Guide

Different effects have different sensitivity to parameter changes:

| Effect | Sensitivity | Noticeable Change Threshold | Notes |
|--------|-------------|----------------------------|-------|
| Pitch Shift | High | ¬±0.5 semitones | Most noticeable effect |
| Formant Shift | Medium | ¬±0.3 units | Best combined with pitch |
| Reverb | Low | 0.1 units | Subtle at low values |
| Echo | Medium | 0.1 units | Creates distinct repeats |
| Distortion | Very High | 0.05 units | Use sparingly |
| Compression | Low | 0.2 units | Cumulative effect |
| EQ Bass | Medium | 0.2 units | Affects voice weight |
| EQ Mid | High | 0.1 units | Affects voice clarity |
| EQ Treble | Medium | 0.1 units | Affects articulation |

   - US voices typically work better for casual content
   - UK voices often suit formal or educational content
   - Test multiple voices with the same content to find the best match

4. **Effect Parameter Guidelines**:
   - **Always start with low settings** (30-40% of maximum) and increase gradually
   - Apply effects in stages rather than all at once
   - Use effect_blend parameter to control overall intensity
   - Save your favorite parameter combinations for reuse

5. **Memory Usage Considerations**:
   - Process texts under 1000 characters for optimal performance
   - Close other GPU-intensive applications when using GPU acceleration
   - Monitor system resource usage during processing
   - Consider using CPU mode if experiencing GPU memory errors

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Audio Quality Issues**:
   - **Choppy or stuttering audio**: Reduce effects intensity or process shorter text segments
   - **Robotic artifacts**: Lower formant shift values and use higher quality libraries
   - **Unnatural pauses**: Check text punctuation and formatting
   - **Distortion**: Lower output volume and reduce effect intensity

2. **Performance Issues**:
   - **Slow processing**: Switch to CPU mode for short texts, GPU for longer ones
   - **High memory usage**: Process text in smaller chunks
   - **CUDA errors**: Ensure your GPU drivers are updated and CUDA is properly installed
   - **Timeout errors**: Increase node timeout settings in ComfyUI configuration

3. **Effect-Specific Issues**:
   - **Weird pitch shift artifacts**: Install resampy for better quality
   - **Reverb sounds metallic**: Reduce reverb amount to 0.3-0.4
   - **Compression pumping**: Reduce compression to 0.3-0.5
   - **Voice blending sounds unnatural**: Adjust blend ratio closer to 1.0 (more primary voice)

4. **Diagnostic Steps**:
   - Check ComfyUI console for error messages
   - Try disabling effects one by one to identify problematic ones
   - Test with default settings to establish a baseline
   - Verify model files are properly installed and accessible
