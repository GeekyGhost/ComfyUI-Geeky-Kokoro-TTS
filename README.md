## 🎯 Text Chunking Fix Details

The **major issue** you reported has been completely resolved:

### Problem (Before):
```
Input: "Line 1. Line 2. Line 3. Line 4."
Output: [skips Line 1] "Line 2. Line 3. Line 1 Line 4."
```

### Solution (After):
- **Improved sentence detection** using regex patterns
- **Paragraph-aware chunking** that preserves structure  
- **Order preservation** ensures chunks maintain original sequence
- **Better punctuation handling** for various sentence endings
- **Seamless concatenation** with natural pauses

### New Chunking Algorithm:
1. **Text normalization** (clean whitespace, preserve paragraphs)
2. **Paragraph splitting** to maintain document structure
3. **Sentence-boundary detection** using advanced regex
4. **Smart chunk assembly** respecting size limits while preserving order
5. **Natural gap insertion** between chunks for smooth speech flow

## 🚀 Usage Guide

### Basic Text-to-Speech
1. Add "🔊 Geeky Kokoro TTS (Updated)" node to your workflow
2. Enter your text in the multiline text field
3. Select a voice from the dropdown
4. Adjust speed if needed (1.0 = normal)
5. Enable GPU if available for faster processing

### Voice Blending (Advanced)
1. Enable "enable_blending" checkbox
2. Select a second voice from "second_voice" dropdown
3. Adjust "blend_ratio":
   - 1.0 = 100% primary voice
   - 0.5 = 50/50 mix
   - 0.0 = 100% secondary voice

### Voice Effects Processing
1. Connect TTS output to "🔊 Geeky Kokoro Advanced Voice" node
2. Choose a voice profile preset OR enable manual mode
3. Adjust effect parameters to taste
4. Use "effect_blend" to mix with original audio
