## üìö Usage Guide

### Geeky Kokoro TTS Node

1. Add the "üîä Geeky Kokoro TTS" node to your workflow
2. Connect inputs:
   - **text**: Enter the text you want to convert to speech
   - **voice**: Select a voice from the dropdown
   - **speed**: Adjust the speech rate (0.5 to 2.0)
   - **use_gpu**: Enable GPU acceleration (if available)
3. Optional parameters:
   - **enable_blending**: Turn on voice blending
   - **second_voice**: Select a second voice for blending
   - **blend_ratio**: Adjust the mix between primary and secondary voices
4. Outputs:
   - **audio**: Connect to audio playback or save nodes
   - **text_processed**: The processed text after normalization

#### Voice Blending Example
To create a custom voice blend:
1. Enable the "enable_blending" toggle
2. Select a primary voice (e.g., "üá∫üá∏ üö∫ Heart ‚ù§Ô∏è")
3. Choose a secondary voice (e.g., "üá¨üáß üöπ George")
4. Adjust the blend ratio (0.0 to 1.0):
   - 1.0 = 100% primary voice
   - 0.5 = 50% primary + 50% secondary
   - 0.0 = 100% secondary voice

This can create unique voice combinations that aren't available as standard voices.

### Geeky Kokoro Voice Mod Node (Beta)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The Voice Mod node is currently in beta. Some effects may not work as expected and may be subject to change.

1. Add the "üîä Geeky Kokoro Advanced Voice" node to your workflow
2. Connect the audio input (typically from the TTS node)
3. Choose between:
   - **Presets**: Quick voice transformations (e.g., "Chipmunk", "Robot Voice", "Podcast")
   - **Custom Settings**: Manually configure individual effects

#### Effect Groups (Custom Settings)
The Voice Mod node organizes effects into logical groups that can be enabled independently:

- **Voice Morphing**: Transform voice character (Child, Masculine, Elder, etc.)
- **Pitch & Formant**: Adjust pitch, formant shift, and auto-tune
- **Time Effects**: Change playback speed or add vibrato
- **Spatial Effects**: Add reverb and echo
- **Tone Controls**: Adjust EQ bands (bass, mids, treble) and add harmonics
- **Effects**: Apply distortion, tremolo, bitcrush, and noise reduction
- **Dynamics**: Compression and analog warmth simulation
- **Character Effects**: Special transformations like Robot, Telephone, Whisper, etc.

#### Using Presets
For quick voice transformations, use the preset system:
1. Select a preset from the dropdown (e.g., "Robot Voice", "Chipmunk", "Deep Voice")
2. Adjust the preset_strength parameter (0.0 to 1.0) to control intensity
3. Set effect_blend (0.0 to 1.0) to mix with the original voice

## üîç Technical Details

### Audio Processing Architecture

The Voice Mod node uses a multi-layered approach to audio processing:

1. **Primary Implementation**: Uses librosa and resampy for high-quality processing
2. **Fallback Layer 1**: Uses scipy-based algorithms when resampy is unavailable
3. **Fallback Layer 2**: Uses numpy-only implementations when scipy is unavailable

This ensures the node can function even when optional dependencies are missing, but with potentially reduced quality.

### Key Code Components

#### Fallback System
The `audio_utils.py` file contains fallback implementations for when specialized audio libraries aren't available:

```python
# Example of the phase vocoder fallback when resampy isn't available
def stft_phase_vocoder(audio, sr, n_steps, bins_per_octave=12):
    """
    Phase vocoder pitch shifting using STFT, more advanced than simple resampling
    """
    if abs(n_steps) < 0.01:
        return audio
        
    # Convert steps to rate
    rate = 2.0 ** (-n_steps / bins_per_octave)
    
    # STFT parameters
    n_fft = 2048
    hop_length = n_fft // 4
    
    # Compute STFT
    D = stft(audio, n_fft=n_fft, hop_length=hop_length)
    
    # Create new spectrogram with adjusted phase progression
    time_steps = D.shape[1]
    new_time_steps = int(time_steps / rate)
    
    # Phase advance
    phase_adv = np.linspace(0, np.pi * rate, D.shape[0])[:, np.newaxis]
    
    # Time-stretch and phase manipulation logic...
    
    # Invert STFT
    y_shift = istft(D_stretch, hop_length=hop_length, length=len(audio))
    
    return y_shift
```

#### Voice Morphing
The voice morphing system uses a combination of effects to create realistic voice transformations:

```python
# Simplified example of voice morphing parameters
morph_params = {
    "Child": {
        "pitch_shift": 4.0,
        "formant_shift": 2.0,
        "brightness": 0.4, 
        "breathiness": 0.3,
        "bass_boost": -0.3,
        "mid_boost": 0.3,
        "compression": 0.2
    },
    "Elder": {
        "pitch_shift": -1.0,
        "formant_shift": -0.5,
        "brightness": -0.2, 
        "breathiness": 0.4,
        "bass_boost": 0.2,
        "mid_boost": -0.2,
        "compression": 0.0,
        "tremolo": 0.2
    },
    # Other voice types...
}
```

### GPU Acceleration
The TTS node leverages GPU acceleration for the Kokoro model when available:

```python
# GPU loading in TTS node with fallback
if use_gpu and True not in self.MODEL and torch.cuda.is_available():
    try:
        with self.MODEL_LOCK:
            self.MODEL[True] = KModel().to('cuda').eval()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"GPU load failed: {e}. Using CPU.")
        use_gpu = False
```

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Advanced Techniques

### Voice Mod Presets
The Voice Mod node includes several presets for common voice transformations:

| Preset | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Chipmunk | High-pitched, child-like voice |
| Deep Voice | Low-pitched, authoritative voice |
| Robot Voice | Mechanical, synthesized voice |
| Phone Call | Classic telephone audio quality |
| Elder Voice | Aged voice with characteristic tremolo |
| Ethereal | Dreamlike, reverb-heavy voice |
| Monster | Deep, distorted, threatening voice |
| Ghost | Eerie, spectral voice with reverb |
| Podcast | Optimized for clarity and warmth (like professional audio) |
| Movie Trailer | Deep, compressed voice for dramatic announcements |

### Known Limitations

- **Auto-tune effect**: Requires librosa; falls back to a basic chorus effect when unavailable
- **Formant shifting**: Most effective with librosa installed
- **High-quality reverb**: Best results with scipy installed
- **Voice morphing**: Some combinations of effects may produce unexpected results
- **Processing time**: Some effects (especially reverb and auto-tune) can be CPU-intensive

## üí° Tips and Tricks

1. **Memory Optimization**: Process shorter text segments when working with complex Voice Mod effects
2. **Voice Consistency**: Use the same voice and settings for multiple text segments to maintain consistency
3. **Custom Voices**: Try different blend ratios between voices to create unique combinations
4. **Pitch Effects**: Subtle pitch adjustments (+/- 1.0) often sound more natural than extreme values
5. **GPU Acceleration**: Use GPU for faster TTS processing, especially with longer texts
6. **Fallback Quality**: Install resampy and librosa for the best audio quality in Voice Mod effects

## üîç Troubleshooting

- **GPU Issues**: If you encounter GPU-related errors, try switching to CPU mode by unchecking the "use_gpu" option
- **Memory Errors**: If you run into memory issues, try processing shorter text segments
- **Audio Distortion**: For distorted output, try reducing effect intensities or disabling some effect groups
- **Missing Dependencies**: Check the console for warnings about missing libraries (librosa, resampy, etc.)
- **Model Load Errors**: Ensure the model files are correctly installed in the `models` directory
